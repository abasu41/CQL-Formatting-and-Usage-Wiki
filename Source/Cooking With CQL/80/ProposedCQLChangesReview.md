# CQL-Next

The Clinical Quality Language (CQL) specification was originally published normative in April of 2020, and has had a technical correction/errata publication (v1.5.2) in January of 2023. The normative reaffirmation will be due in 2025, and the Clinical Decision Support and Clinical Quality Information work groups have been collecting additional feedback and feature requests on the specification. We are considering a v-next of CQL and are consolidating that feedback, as well as seeking any additional feedback from the quality improvement community.

To date, the major areas of feedback we have received are:

* Better support for documentation and unit testing through tags
* Support for a "default comparison precision"
* Better support for direct manipulation of uncertainty
* Ability to define types in the language (DDL)
* Expanded support for terminology operations ( such as `equivalent` semantics for contains)
* Support for a "group by" operator
* Parameter binding support in library includes
* Addition of FHIR-based examples throughout
* Better support for FHIR references

To view the current set of open requests for the CQL specification, see the following JIRA filter:

If you have any additional requests for features of the language, please join the discussion on the CQL Zulip stream:

Or submit a feature request or correction to the HL7 JIRA:

Aspirationally, we are considering a September 2024 ballot timeframe.
