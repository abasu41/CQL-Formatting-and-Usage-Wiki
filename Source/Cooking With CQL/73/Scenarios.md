# Example Scenarios

## SCENARIO 1:

Maria, a 58-year-old female, has been experiencing chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss over the past few months. She also reports occasional rectal bleeding and a feeling of incomplete bowel emptying. Her family history is negative for inflammatory bowel disease, but she has a personal history of recurrent mouth ulcers.

During a physical examination, her doctor notes tenderness in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen and some swelling. A colonoscopy is performed, and biopsies are taken, revealing inflammation and ulceration in the ileum, consistent with Crohn's Disease.

Maria's Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) is also calculated to be 7, indicating moderate to severe disease activity. Additional laboratory tests, such as a fecal calprotectin test, are ordered to help monitor disease activity and assess response to treatment, and value is 80 ug/L.

Maria is started on a treatment plan that includes medication to reduce inflammation and suppress her immune system, as well as dietary modifications to help manage her symptoms. She is also referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management. The goal of treatment is to control her symptoms, prevent complications, and improve her overall quality of life.

## SCENARIO 2:

John, a 32-year-old male, has been experiencing recurrent episodes of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain for the past several months. He reports having to rush to the bathroom up to 10 times per day, and has noticed mucus in his stool. He also reports feeling fatigued and having lost weight unintentionally.

During a physical examination, his doctor notes tenderness in the lower left quadrant of his abdomen and some distension. A sigmoidoscopy is performed, and biopsies are taken, revealing inflammation and ulceration in the rectum and sigmoid colon, consistent with ulcerative colitis.

John's Mayo Clinic Score is also calculated to be 10, indicating severe disease activity. Additional laboratory tests, such as a fecal calprotectin test, are ordered to help monitor disease activity and assess response to treatment, and value is 120 ug/L.

John is started on a treatment plan that includes medication to reduce inflammation and suppress his immune system, as well as dietary modifications to help manage his symptoms. He is also referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management. The goal of treatment is to control his symptoms, prevent complications such as bowel perforation or toxic megacolon, and improve his overall quality of life.
