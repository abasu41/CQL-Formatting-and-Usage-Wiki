*?Data are weighted averages from validation studies.1-2
??Recommendations are consistent with British Thoracic Society guidelines.3 Clinical judgment may overrule the guideline recommendation.
??A CRB-65 score can be calculated by omitting the blood urea nitrogen value, which gives it a point range from 0 to 4. This score is useful when blood tests are not readily available.
