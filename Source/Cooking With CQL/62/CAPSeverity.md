**CURB-65 AND CRB-65 SEVERITY SCORES FOR COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA**

|---|---|
|**Clinical factor** |**Points** |
|Confusion |1 |
|Blood urea nitrogen > 19 mg per dL |1 |
|Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute |1 |
|Systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg<br>or<br>Diastolic blood pressure ≤ 60 mm Hg |1 |
|Age ≥ 65 years |1 |
|**Total points:** | |

|---|---|---|
|**CURB-65 score** |**Deaths/total (%)\*** |**Recommendation†** |
|0 |7/1,223 (0.6) |Low risk; consider home treatment |
|1 |31/1,142 (2.7) | |
|2 |69/1,019 (6.8) |Short inpatient hospitalization or closely supervised outpatient treatment |
|3 |79/563 (14.0) |Severe pneumonia; hospitalize and consider admitting to intensive care |
|4 or 5 |44/158 (27.8) | |

|---|---|---|
|**CRB-65 score‡** |**Deaths/total (%)\*** |**Recommendation†** |
|0 |2/212 (0.9) |Very low risk of death; usually does not require hospitalization |
|1 |18/344 (5.2) |Increased risk of death; consider hospitalization |
|2 |30/251 (12.0) | |
|3 or 4 |39/125 (31.2) |High risk of death; urgent hospitalization |

CURB-65 = Confusion, Urea nitrogen, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, 65 years of age and older.
CRB-65 = Confusion, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, 65 years of age and older.

\*—Data are weighted averages from validation studies.1-2
†—Recommendations are consistent with British Thoracic Society guidelines.3 Clinical judgment may overrule the guideline recommendation.
‡—A CRB-65 score can be calculated by omitting the blood urea nitrogen value, which gives it a point range from 0 to 4. This score is useful when blood tests are not readily available.
